# Life Goal #1: Fix the plastic problem. 
- My best guess on how to achieve this is to evolve [known plastic-eating bacteria](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aad6359) to become more efficient. 
- One problem here is that the bacteria _Ideonella sakaiensis_ can only break down PET and cannot break down the plastic completely.
- I want to create a warehouse of machines that iteratively grow and select the best plastic-eaters. This would be a machine similar to the [Morbidostat](https://www.nature.com/articles/nprot.2013.021).
- I'm looking for people with skills, labor, and funding. If you are a biologist, chemist, or roboticist, contact me.

# Life Goal #2: Invent Neural Search Engine
- My best guess on how to achieve this would involve recieving input by reading brain signals associated with handwriting ([already achieved](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03506-2.epdf?sharing_token=8UZkdjO-Zgm-em7rdp7lC9RgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0No0Kktd9EUuDWeYWONAJ_7c9Vh-4dwWbu73lNBtR0SQDxcHwumbmBTtIhwAjVK86JKifJnIgD0u1IgsIG3u863nE1l4GspSUzHWMbu7_hIgV8IIxs7UKhA0JZsEanQFB2cM60_8bUCiqCRoDKKkaXNAr-HuUD-LzKs55JM62kU5MwFwkPk1Rct7MfSUllIrZIrG5NOvEMZjIULDs6lbmNT8ZZIT6vUSJK8JVbY8GLx0xhq8X8JhCcMOkgnpXqQsN63uHE519N94afEI3hMIzrUG_qCsviAqYi8CepU_95nmg%3D%3D&tracking_referrer=www.theguardian.com)) and outputting the results to the brain via the primary visual cortex ([some progress](https://webvision.med.utah.edu/book/part-xv-prosthetics/introduction-to-visual-prostheses-by-eduardo-fernandez-and-richard-normann/)).
- This is a very difficult goal. I will have to work along hundreds of others.
- If anyone is attempting to solve this problem and needs an programmer/ML specialist/cognition enthusiast, contact me.
